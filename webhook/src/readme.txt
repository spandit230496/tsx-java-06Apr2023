Create a new Spring Boot application: Start by creating a new Spring Boot application using your preferred IDE or command-line tool. You can use the Spring Initializr to create a basic Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies.

Add the necessary dependencies: Add the necessary dependencies to your project.
You'll need to include the Spring Web dependency, which provides support for web applications,
and any other dependencies that you'll be using for your webhook implementation.

Define a controller: Create a new controller class that will handle the incoming webhook requests.
In this controller, you can define the necessary methods and endpoints to handle the webhook requests.

Implement the webhook logic: Write the code that will handle the webhook requests.
This will typically involve parsing the incoming request data,
validating the request, and performing any necessary actions based on the webhook data.

Configure the webhook endpoint: Configure the endpoint where your webhook will receive requests.
This typically involves specifying the URL and HTTP method that the webhook will use to send requests to your application.

Test the webhook: Test your webhook by sending test requests to your application and verifying that the expected behavior occurs.

Secure the webhook: Finally, make sure to secure your webhook by implementing any necessary
authentication and authorization measures to prevent unauthorized access to your webhook endpoint.
